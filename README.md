# IT Security Note and tools

This repository contains a bunch of tool and note regarding IT Security. Since I am starting a journey to IT security, I though I could be interesting to have a place for my note and tools and share it with the community.

There will not be any solution for challenges like rootme or hackthebox but only notes that I gather and think that it could be interesting to keep somewhere in the repo. I have notes of challenges achieved but it is in a private repository ;).

Git is perfect for this because of its history feature. And we can easily do a search through the entire repository using a IDE like Netbeans , Visual Studio Code and so on ...

## Notes

Devided into multiple topics. Inside you will find note regarding certain aspect of IT Security that I could have discovered and learn through Internet / Challenge / CTF, etc ....


## Tools

A bunch of tool that I have wrote to help me in my challenges, CTF in order to automate certain things. You will find them with a readme file explaining how to run them.
